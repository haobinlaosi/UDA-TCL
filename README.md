# UDA-TCL
UDA-TCL (Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Time patch Contrastive Learning) is a novel framework for time series domain adaptation that addresses distribution shifts between source and target domains through a dual-branch architecture combining contrastive learning and time patch convolution.

# Key Features:
**Cross-Domain Contrastive Learning**: Bidirectional alignment strategy treating source and target domain samples as queries and keys
**Time Patch Convolutional Network**: Hierarchical dual-pathway architecture separating local and global temporal feature learning
**Clustering-Based Pseudo-Labeling**: Source domain knowledge-guided target domain label generation
**Dual-Branch Architecture**: Joint optimization of source domain classification and cross-domain alignment

# Experimental Scenarios
**Single Domain Shift**: Individual differences in human activity recognition
**Multiple Domain Shift**: Complex scenarios involving laboratory-to-real-world adaptation 

# Code Availability
The complete source code implementation will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance. This repository currently contains the datasets, preprocessing utilities, and experimental setup to facilitate reproducibility.
